# Topology of Search, Search in Topology

The code available in this repository is part of my dissertation. I expect it will be very active until Summary 2022. What will happen next will depend on how sound the output will be. If you are interested in similar topics, I'd be [happy to chat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalporeba/). If you think my approach makes no sense, I'd love to hear from you - [create an issue](https://github.com/michalporeba/toposearch/issues/new/choose) and let me know where I went wrong. 

## Keywords

[Federated Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_search), Search Results Aggregation, [OpenSearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch), Decentralised Data Solutions, Hypermedia in RESTful API, [Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)

## Why? 

To improve data discoverability in systems where centralisation is not an option. 
To improve the search results based on the relative location of the searcher and the information in the network topology. 
To find a mechanism to send feedback and suggest data improvements from the results back to the data sources.
To get ready for a more distributed data landscape. 

## What?

An API 
A Service 
A Demo

## How? (The current idea)
The search query will be federated (distributed) in a mesh search network.
The results will be filtered by the source systems 
The results will be moderated by the network
The results will be aggregated before presenting them to the user
The feedback will be pushed back through the network to the source systems to suggest updates. 


# The Problem

We have increasing amounts of data all around us. Discoverability is a challenge. It is especially true in systems where fine-grained access controls are necessary across organisational boundaries. 

Public crawling and indexing are not possible. Centralisation of data in data warehouses and lakes are currently the go-to solution. But that means the data governance has to be centralised. While it works in some organisations, it poses significant challenges in heterogeneous systems and searches between multiple organisations. 

The increasing amount of data results in a rising number of possible search results.
