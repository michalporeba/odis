# Contributions to the Project

If you are interested in the problems I explore in this repository, 
if you have ideas you want to share in this space, please commont on [existing issues](https://github.com/michalporeba/toposearch/issues), 
or [raise new ones](https://github.com/michalporeba/toposearch/issues/new/choose). 
I'd love to hear from you, especially if you think what I'm doing makes little, or no sense!

However, as this project is part of my dissertation in Applied Software Engineering, 
I will not be able to accept code contributions until June 2022. I have to do all the coding until then!
