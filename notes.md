## Possible use cases

### Food and drink as department surrogate

http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ - a collection of data. There are online reviews for beers, wines, movies and foods. Perhaps this sort of data could represent different departments interested in slightly different things. A search from a department of beers would return beer first, and then show wines and others and so on. 

### Open UK Data 

Searching for physical locations in public datasets https://data.gov.uk/
Could result in aggregated results, but feedback would be difficult to show.
