## Unauthenticated flow

*Or a flow of a public user authenticated only with a weak identity*

![Unauthenticated flow](./images/interactions-f0.png)

A public user can discover and search any publically available data. 
Somme of that data may be stored centrally, while the others delivered directly
from the source services. 

Each organisation can decide which nodes in their control respond to public
requests for data, and which services support those requests.

## Authenticated public flow

*A flow for a user identified with a government issued digital identity.*

![Authenticated public flow](./images/interactions-f1.png)

A person authenticated by a strong identity provider can access all 
the publically available data, but also request their information 
(their personal information, businesses they own and similar). 

Each organisation can choose which nodes in their control respond to 
authenticated public requests and which services support those requests.
