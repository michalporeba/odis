# Architecture

To document the design of the system I will use the [C4 modelling notation](https://c4model.com/).

## Context view

![Context](./images/c4-context.png)

There are five types of users interacting with the system:

* The **Searcher** - person looking for information who is at the same time the person who understands the information and can offer feedback.
* The **Data Service Developer** - person who wants to make the information discoverable. 
* The **Search Administrator** - person responsible for the operation of the search network.
* The **Information Asset Owner / Manager** - person responsible for the information stored in the source service and who is responsible for controlling the access to it. 
* The **Cyber Security Person** - person responsible for maintaing the security of the solution.
