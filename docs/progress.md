# Progress of the Project

To monitor and control the progress of the project I'm using an approach based on [*#NoEstimates*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBlnCTu9Ms) *(if you haven't heard of it, I strongly recommend watching the linked video).*

## Week 5 - 2022-01-10 - 2022-01-16

## Summary

The development is going rather slowly, but steady progress is made daily. 
A few problems with technical details of the implementation clearly resulted in less progress than I hoped for in week 4,
but those have now been resolved. 

The 'scope creep' is almost exactly x1.3 as predicted so everything appears to be on track. 

## Project Details
I have started the project on the 2021-12-09 and will have to finish by 2022-07-04. Phase 1 covers the first 14 weeks until the progress report, and Phase 2 covers the rest.
