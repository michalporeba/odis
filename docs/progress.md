## Week 3 - 2021-12-27 -- 2022-01-02
*(Predictions are currently not very useful as there are only two incomplete data points.

more reliable data is available).*

## Summary

So far the first two weeks were spent mostly on project setup and additional learning. 
I was able to do more than I hoped for. 

## Project Details
I have started the project on the 2021-12-09 and will have to finish by 2022-07-04. Phase 1 covers the first 14 weeks until the progress report, and Phase 2 covers the rest.
