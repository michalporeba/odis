# No More Catalogs (Not really a use case)

Data catalogous, repositories, registers, are the standard
solution to data governance and discoverability problems. 

But this means the information is often detached from the places it is produced, the metadata is managed with different tools, by different teams from the data itself. 

The federated search approach is about searching for the data much closer to the source, hopefully in the source system itself. 
With that, the search netwrok needs to know about the services and could be used to make the metadata, and the services searchable as well as the data itself.
