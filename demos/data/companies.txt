There will be a scenario involving three departments and the STW window

1. DIT wants to store information about exporters
2. Companies house defines companies, but the model is not suitable for DIT
3. DIT builds exporters service
4. DIT builds importers service
5. ESS+ISS to single list 
6. ESS+ISS to single object 
7. DEFRA creates a licencing service - they want to populate the data about the company
8. Single Trade Window wants to see it all (linked actions -> search)
9. Limit the above to DIT+DEFRA (linked constraints)
10 Add HMRC (ODIS)
